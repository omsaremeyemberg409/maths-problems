# Problem 1: Find the sum of two numbers
sum_1 = 5 + 3

# Problem 2: Calculate the area of a rectangle
area_rectangle = 4 * 6

# Problem 3: Calculate the volume of a cylinder
volume_cylinder = 3.14 * (5 ** 2) - (25 + 8) * 5

# Problem 4: Add two numbers with different bases
base_a, base_b, exponent = 4, 9, 2
result = pow(base_a, exponent) + pow(base_b, exponent)
