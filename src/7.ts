<p>
Find the value of x in the equation:<br>
3x + 5 = 20<br>

Solution:<br>
Subtract 5 from both sides: <br>
3x = 15<br>
Divide by 3 on both sides:<br>
x = 5<br>
Therefore, the value of x is 5.

<p>
Find the value of y in the equation:<br>
y = 2x + 1<br>

Solution:<br>
Substitute x = 4 into the equation: <br>
y = 2(4) + 1 = 9.

<summary>Problem 4</summary>
<p>
Find the value of a in the equation:<br>
a/2 + b/3 = 5<br>

Solution:<br>
Multiply both sides by 6 to isolate a: <br>
a + b = 30<br>
Since we know that a = 15 and b = 10, we can find the value of a:<br>
a = 15.
